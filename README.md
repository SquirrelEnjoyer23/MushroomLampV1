# MushroomLampV1
The First Version of my mushroom lamp
This lamp is meant to be customizable and DIY, utilizing a arduino as the main controller allowing for custom code to be ran that can allow for special patterns and customizable options for the front brightness dial, as well since it uses addressable led's it allows for even more customization.

Runs off of: 9v 3 AMP barrel jack

Arduino: 9v

Led Strip: 5v

**Materials used:**

3D printed cyliner OR a pipe of similar size

3D printed dome

3D printed knob for light control OR something of your choice

3D printed bottom and top for the cylinder OR somthing that is equivalent (Top is already included in the 3D model)

Barrel jack splitter (1 female to 2 male)

Buck converter to 5V

Rotary encoder (can be mounted on a pcb)

Led strip (12 inches, addressable, RGB, 5V, preferably 60 leds) DEPENDING on your led strip you may need to cut connectors off

Arduino Uno

Wall plug that outputs 9v 3 amp (or 5 if you want to be on the safer side) to a barrel jack

Jumper cables (just for the arduino to talk to the lights as well as the encoder to arduino)

**It is recommended to get high quality components especially for the splitter and the buck converter**


**Tools required**

3D printer (or access to one if using the 3D models)

Drill (to make holes to pass wires through)

Soldering iron (depending on the parts you use, screw terminals and connectors can be used without one)

Super glue

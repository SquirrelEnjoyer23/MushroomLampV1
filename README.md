# MushroomLampV1
The First Version of my mushroom lamp
This lamp is meant to be customizable and DIY, utilizing a arduino as the main controller allowing for custom code to be ran that can allow for special patterns and customizable options for the front brightness dial, as well since it uses addressable led's it allows for even more customization.

Runs off of: 9v 3 AMP barrel jack

Arduino: 9v

Led Strip: 5v

USB C splitter (1 female to 2 male)

Rotary encoder (can be mounted on a pcb)

Led strip (12 inches, addressable, RGB, 5V, preferably 60 leds) DEPENDING on your led strip you may need to cut connectors off

Esp32

Wall plug that outputs to USB C

Jumper cables (just for the esp32 to talk to the lights as well as the encoder to esp32)

**It is recommended to get high quality components especially for the splitter and the buck converter**

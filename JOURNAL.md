On this day i decided to start on the project or the modeling of it at least, using onshape i started with making the cylinder which would act as the main part of the lamp as it would be the base and hold all of the components and where things would be plugged in for power! and after making the cylinder i moved onto making the dome part of the lamp also in onshape but the sizes were far from final, Overall this was a fairly light day as i still wasnt sure what i was going to be using for the electronic part of it

On this day not much progress was made however i was attempting to figure out the final sizes so i decided to make a model it in blender to see how it would look I also decided to make the component that would allow the dome to sit on the cylinder which just turned out to be a hollow cylinder that would slide over.

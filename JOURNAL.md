On this day i decided to start on the project or the modeling of it at least, using onshape i started with making the cylinder which would act as the main part of the lamp as it would be the base and hold all of the components and where things would be plugged in for power! and after making the cylinder i moved onto making the dome part of the lamp also in onshape but the sizes were far from final, Overall this was a fairly light day as i still wasnt sure what i was going to be using for the electronic part of it

On this day not much progress was made however i was attempting to figure out the final sizes so i decided to make a model it in blender to see how it would look I also decided to make the component that would allow the dome to sit on the cylinder which just turned out to be a hollow cylinder that would slide over.

Today after researching the potential parts that can be used in the build i have decided on using, a barrel jack splitter, arduino uno, 9v to 5v buck converter, addressable rgb led strip, and a rotary encoder, These parts should make it easy to fix and change parts out while also giving room for customization of the code running the led's and as such changing things like what the controls on the rotary encoder do, Now that i have decided on using these parts next time i need to design the mechanism to hold the rotary encoder as well as a 3D model for the knob, and maybe even a specialized holder for the arduino and converter to make sure its nice and neat when it is stored away.

**Total time spent: 2h (research was across multiple days but not decided on till now)**

# 5/24/2025
Today was spent researching specific components as it can be one thing to pick what parts to use and another to pick what you will use exactly, this is also seen in the ReadMe with the parts list so i could finally start looking at the overall cost, it seems like the lamp will fit in the budget although not really suprising seeing how basic it is, and today was also spent making fairly basic models that could be used in the project, i started with making something similar to a standoff that could be used to mount the parts inside as i have decided not to make the custom holders like i thought before (to save time and money), however i was unsure about the exact sizes that would be used so i made them slightly larger than i expect them to be used as, that way they can be sanded down or cut down when needed

And then next i made the hardest model ever.... a flat disk to be used as the top and bottom of the lamp, while it may be simple this is essential to making it look professional, and i did the same thing with this model by making them larger than i expect them to be used as to allow for a perfect fit by sanding it down just enough to make a nice seal on the bottom and top, over all about 30 minutes was spent making these 2 models, but about 3 hours was spent researching parts

**Total time spent: 3 1/2 hours (most of which was in research)**

# 5/29/2025
In a effort to make the build cheaper i decided to move more towards USB c as i already have most of the parts on hand and the parts i would need would be much cheaper, doing this also gets rid of the converter and exchanges some of the parts for different ones (barrel splitter turning into a usb c splitter, arduino turning into a esp32, wall power from barrel to usb c)

Today i got the pipe all cleaned up as it was sitting outside for a while in the back yard, and put the newly 3d printed dome ontop and it turned out pretty good, now it is just time to wait for the aliexpress parts to arrive to actually make it work! and once i have a working prototype of the lamp then i will cut the pipe to the hight i want and put some finishing touches.

**Total time spent: 3 hours (cleaning up the dome and cleaning the pipe)**

# 6/21/2025
Today i cut the pipe to the size i want it to be and also my parts arrived but not all of them yet! hopefully in the next few days i can get it all assembled.

Today was a really exciting day i was able to get the led's working while connected to my arduino uno that i was using for testing, tommarow ill solder together the wires to make a better connection and then do some test fits in the actual lamp and try it with the rotary encoder hooked up!

Today i soldered together the power connector and the led wires and put some shrink wrap on it, i also cutout the light diffuser to fit on the dome, two steps closer to finishing the project!

Today and over the past few days (i didnt journal it) i was working towards making the project final and today i decided to finally peace it all together with the painted tube and the wires all connected!

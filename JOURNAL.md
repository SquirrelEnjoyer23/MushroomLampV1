On this day i decided to start on the project or the modeling of it at least, using onshape i started with making the cylinder which would act as the main part of the lamp as it would be the base and hold all of the components and where things would be plugged in for power!
This was a fairly light day as i still wasnt sure what i was going to be using for the electronic part of it. But since its only my 2nd time using onshape i was still getting used to the controls so it ended up taking me a afternoon, this day also consisted with me testing the sizes with rulers and measuing tapes to try and find what could be a nice size but could change later!

On this day i decided to start moddeling the dome for the lamp, but this was fairly easy since i now have more experience with onshape and took me almost no time at all!
The dome is just a half sphere carved out but i still havent decided on the thickness or size yet!
